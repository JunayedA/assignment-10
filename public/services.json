      "about": "Pediatricians take care of patients from infancy through age 18 or, in some cases, age 21.5 Pediatricians provide primary health care to children, including vaccinations, general health checkups, school physicals, and treatment of issues like coughs, colds, and stomach flu. If a patient has a more serious illness, their pediatrician may refer them to pediatric sub-specialist (e.g., a pediatric orthopedist is a doctor who specializes in treating young patients with bone and muscle concerns). After they graduate from medical school, pediatricians spend at least three years in a residency program that is focused on pediatric medicine. If they choose to study a pediatric subspecialty, they will then attend a fellowship for that subspecialty."

They may have an office-based practice or work as a hospitalist primarily seeing patients in the hospital. These physicians attend medical school followed by an internal medicine residency. Internists may then choose to pursue a fellowship to sub-specialize in a variety of other areas, like endocrinology (hormone-related conditions) or cardiology (heart-related issues).4"

They are usually the first to recognize major health problems, order diagnostic tests, and refer patients to specialists when needed.2 After attending medical school, family medicine physicians attend a family medicine residency program for three to five years. During this time, they will receive hands-on training in pediatric care, emergency medicine, and other areas of general medicine.3"
